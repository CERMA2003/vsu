An earthquake (also known as a quake, 
tremor or temblor) is the perceptible 
shaking of the surface of the Earth, 
resulting from the sudden release of 
energy in the Earth's crust that creates 
seismic waves. Earthquakes can be violent 
enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The seismicity or seismic activity of an area refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time.
