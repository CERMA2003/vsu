In the Philippines, tropical cyclones (typhoons) are called bagyo. 
Tropical cyclones entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility 
are given a local name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical 
and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which also raises 
public storm signal warnings as deemed necessary. Around 19 tropical 
cyclones or storms enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility in a 
typical year and of these usually 6 to 9 make landfall.
