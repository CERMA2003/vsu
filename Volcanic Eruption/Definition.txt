A volcano is a vent in the earth's crust through wh
ich molten rock (magma), rock 
fragments, gases, and ashes are ejected from the ea
rth's interior. 
A volcano is created when magma erupts onto the sur
face of the earth. Volcanoes take 
many forms according to the chemical composition of
 their magma and the conditions in 
which the magma is erupted. When magma is erupted i
t is referred to as lava. Some lava 
known as 'basalts' is hot and fluid. Opposite of ba
salts are 'rhyolites', which are 
characterized by their inability to flow freely, er
upt explosively or form steep domes. 
Midway in between are 'andesites' which are thick, 
flow slowly, and are mildly explosive.
